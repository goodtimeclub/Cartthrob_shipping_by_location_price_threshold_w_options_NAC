# NAC gift cards shipping options plugin

This is an ExpressionEngine 2 plugin for CartThrob 2.71 which provides patrons with additional options for shipping their [gift card](https://nac-cna.ca/en/giftcards) from us at the [National Arts Centre](https://nac-cna.ca/en)

## Description
Based on [this plugin](https://github.com/CartThrob/shipping-quantity-threshold-plus-options/blob/master/Cartthrob_shipping_by_location_quantity_threshold_w_options.php), it allows users to choose an express shipping option if they're product's price is within the given threshold. For example, we offer express shipping for orders under $100, but only for orders shipped within the country â€“ however, orders over $99 within Canada automatically apply this option.

**Installation**
Requires EE 2.x. 
1. move file to system > expressionengine > third_party > cartthrob > cartthrob > plugins > shipping. 
2. Visit Modules > CartThrob > Shipping and select "NAC shipping options"
3. Specify a shipping price for default and express(if offered)
4. Specify a price threshold at which to offer each option

### Caveat
This plugin is not fully-tested and should not be considered ready for production. If you plan to use it, it may require some effort to make it work on the template side.
